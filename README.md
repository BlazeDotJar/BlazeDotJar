Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a twenty years old, native german Java coding hobbyist who
loves to code plugins for multiplayer
servers in Minecraft.

Since I am an electrician, my job has nearly nothing todo with coding,
I also never had a job in that direction.
So I had to teach me everything I have to know to be able
to ingeneer and code plugins.
